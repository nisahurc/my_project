# my_project
This project is a Flutter project written in Dart language. I used Firebase Auth and Firebase Cloud in this project. I kept user-specific tasks and the durations of these tasks in Firebase. Actually, my project generally has tasks and each task has a different duration, I made daily, weekly and monthly charts according to these durations. On the add friends page, I created and displayed a list of friends by searching with people's emails.
